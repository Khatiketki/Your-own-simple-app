# Your-own-simple-app
Purpose: This assignment will give you the abilities needed to create a basic application that uses a REST API.

Task: 

Choose any free-to-use API available on the internet. A few lists of free APIs are hereLinks to an external site., hereLinks to an external site., and hereLinks to an external site..
Be careful to choose an API that does not ask you for credit card information or any other information you don't want to compromise.
Create a page that:
Connects to the API and gets information from it,
Displays that data on the page.
The page must have semantic HTML and acceptable CSS to make it user-friendly.

The above are the minimum requirements. Doing the above well is enough to get the full 30 points!

For an extra challenge (no bonus points), try: 

Including a list of available resources so the user can click on a link and the related data is displayed.
Requesting data from the user (using a form) and then using that to compose the API call. For example, search for something and display the results. from the search.
Using fetch() is recommended, but you may use other methods to consume data from APIs if you research them.

You will submit: the URL of the GitHub repository containing the files of your app.

Examples:

Use this APILinks to an external site. to display a random joke.
Use this Star Trek APILinks to an external site. to list the names and information for all of the starships.
Use the same API to allow the user to search for one particular starship.
Use the Serialif Color APILinks to an external site. to get all data from a random color, then use those colors on the page.
Get a zip code from the user (5 digits), then use the Zippopotam.us APILinks to an external site. to display information about that zip code.
Criteria:

The page must work as is. No broken links, etc.
We will download the contents of the GitHub repo you provide to our computers. The page must work on our computers.
The page must have valid HTML and CSS.
The page must get data from the API. No static data will be accepted. A page that does not get data from APIs will get 0 points.
